                Hi, I'm Dylan! This site is my cookbook, a place for me to share recipes
                I've made that have turned out well while cooking for myself at home.
                It's split between savory suppers and sweet treats. These recipes have served me
                well, and I hope they'll serve y'all well too.
                Have fun cooking!

                                <p>
                                    The simplest, fastest, and most straight-forward recipe in this
                                    cookbook. It's something anyone can figure out, right?
                                    Wrong. I know a trick or too for bacon and eggs that will take
                                    your breakfast tacos to the next level!
                                    This is a super dish. It works for breakfast, lunch, brunch,
                                    dinner, midnight snack - whenever. It might be the best recipe
                                    here, even if its the simplest.

                                <li>
                                    Start Cooking Bacon

                                    <ol type = 'a'>
                                        <li>
                                            Begin heating a frying pan at medium-high heat.
                                            Cover with parchment paper. This will catch the grease
                                            from the bacon, so it's easier to dispose of!
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Place strips of Bacon onto the parchment paper.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Lightly pepper the bacon (no salt) and add a pinch
                                            of MSG
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Cook until you see the bacon begin to brown on the
                                            under side (about 8 min).
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Flip the bacon. Let it cook until both sides brown.
                                            About 6 more min.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Let bacon sit on a paper towel for about 2 min.
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Heat Tortillas (while Bacon cooking)

                                    <br>

                                    In a clean pan (or directly over the flame if you have
                                    a gas stove), heat tortillas on each side. Don't use
                                    a microwave because it just won't taste as good.

                                    <br>

                                    Distribute the cheese amongst each taco to let it melt.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Scramble Eggs (while Bacon cooking)

                                    <br>

                                    Eggs are crucial, so do NOT use what <i> you </i> think is
                                    best. Trust the recipe. If you listen to nothing else I say,
                                    listen to how to do these eggs. These are THE best way to make
                                    eggs for breakfast tacos! I promise you.

                                    <ol type = 'a'>
                                        <li> Begin heating a small pan to high temperature. </li>
                                        <li> Crack your 3 eggs into a bowl or plate with rim. </li>
                                        <li> Scramble well. </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Season with the tspns of salt, pepper, and MSG, and
                                            stir well.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Once the pan is heated, poor the tbspns of Avacado oil
                                            in and let it begin to simmer and glisten.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Poor your eggs in. They will quickly begin to fry and
                                            bubble. Use a spatula to stir them and scramble them.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Once the eggs have finished cooking, you will have
                                            perfect, thick, fluffy eggs to make up the substantive
                                            part of the breakfast taco.
                                            A breakfast taco makes or breaks at this step.

                                        <li>
                                            Distribute the eggs among the three tortillas equally.

                                            Dash a bit of hot sauce on each of the three

                                    tenderloin at home. A steak method that leaves it so tender
                                    that it will tear in your fingers and can be cut with plastic.

                                    180g Espresso (will not explain how to make good espresso here
                                    as that could be its own website!).
                                    I do 3x 60g shots at a 1:2 ratio (30g in; I have a massive cup)
                                    and not the best shots (doesn't need to be).

                                            Put the sugar, vanilla, and heavy whipping cream in a
                                            bowl, and whisk til the sugar isn't sticking to the
                                            bowl.

                                            Mix in another 1 tbsp of pumpkin spice and mix.
                                            Continue to taste. This is enough for me.

                                    Make Layer 1

                                    <ol type = 'a'>
                                        <li> Pour the coffee into a shallow bowl or a plate. </li>
                                        <li>
                                            One by one, dip the lady fingers on either side into
                                            the coffee and lay them along the bottom of your dish.
                                            Do NOT soak!!! Lightly dip either side lest you have a
                                            pool of espresso by the end not a tiramisu.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Put half the whipped cream on top and smooth it out.
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>

                                    Make Layer 2

                                    <ol type = 'a'>
                                        <li>
                                            Repeat making a layer: dip and arrange the fingers
                                            (now on top of the previous) and top with whipped cream
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Dust with more Pumpkin Spice. Make sure to really
                                            do a thin layer as it is a very strong flavor!
                                            I recommend blowing it from your hand over the
                                            dish, even though it makes a mess.

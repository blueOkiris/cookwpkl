                Hi, I'm Dylan! This site is my cookbook, a place for me to share recipes
                I've made that have turned out well while cooking for myself at home.
                It's split between savory suppers and sweet treats. These recipes have served me
                well, and I hope they'll serve y'all well too.
                Have fun cooking!
            </p>
            <p>
                NOTE: This website is currently a WORK IN PROGRESS.
                I have not finished filling out the initial set of recipes.

                                <p>
                                    The simplest, fastest, and most straight-forward recipe in this
                                    cookbook. It's something anyone can figure out, right?
                                    Wrong. I know a trick or too for bacon and eggs that will take
                                    your breakfast tacos to the next level!
                                    This is a super dish. It works for breakfast, lunch, brunch,
                                    dinner, midnight snack - whenever. It might be the best recipe
                                    here, even if its the simplest.

                                    Start Cooking Bacon

                                    <ol type = 'a'>
                                        <li>
                                            Begin heating a frying pan at medium-high heat.
                                            Cover with parchment paper. This will catch the grease
                                            from the bacon, so it's easier to dispose of!
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Place strips of Bacon onto the parchment paper.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Lightly pepper the bacon (no salt) and add a pinch
                                            of MSG
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Cook until you see the bacon begin to brown on the
                                            under side (about 8 min).
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Flip the bacon. Let it cook until both sides brown.
                                            About 6 more min.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Let bacon sit on a paper towel for about 2 min.
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Heat Tortillas (while Bacon cooking)

                                    <br>

                                    In a clean pan (or directly over the flame if you have
                                    a gas stove), heat tortillas on each side. Don't use
                                    a microwave because it just won't taste as good.

                                    <br>

                                    Distribute the cheese amongst each taco to let it melt.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Scramble Eggs (while Bacon cooking)

                                    <br>

                                    Eggs are crucial, so do NOT use what <i> you </i> think is
                                    best. Trust the recipe. If you listen to nothing else I say,
                                    listen to how to do these eggs. These are THE best way to make
                                    eggs for breakfast tacos! I promise you.

                                        <li> Begin heating a small pan to high temperature. </li>
                                        <li> Crack your 3 eggs into a bowl or plate with rim. </li>
                                        <li> Scramble well. </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Season with the tspns of salt, pepper, and MSG, and
                                            stir well.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Once the pan is heated, poor the tbspns of Avacado oil
                                            in and let it begin to simmer and glisten.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Poor your eggs in. They will quickly begin to fry and
                                            bubble. Use a spatula to stir them and scramble them.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Once the eggs have finished cooking, you will have
                                            perfect, thick, fluffy eggs to make up the substantive
                                            part of the breakfast taco.
                                            A breakfast taco makes or breaks at this step.
